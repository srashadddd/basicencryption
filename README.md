# Encryption & Decryption Web App  
A simple web tool using **Caesar Cipher (shift = 3)** for text encryption and decryption.

## Features  
- Encrypt & decrypt text instantly  
- Clean, minimal UI  
- Works in any browser—no installation required  

## How It Works  
- **Encryption:** Shifts letters forward by 3 (e.g., `A → D`)  
- **Decryption:** Restores original text by shifting backward  

## Usage  
1. Enter text in the encryption box and click **Encrypt**  
2. Copy encrypted text, paste it into the decryption box  
3. Click **Decrypt** to retrieve the original message  

## Future Improvements  
- Customizable shift values  
- Support for numbers & symbols
